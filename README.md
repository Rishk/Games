# Higher or Lower :black_joker:

Two-player card game built using Vue.js.

The rules can be found on the [site](https://higherorlower.rishk.me).

Todo:
- Add field for users to change the number of cards per player.
- Add field for users to configure the number of players and their names.

Both only require front-end changes as the logic already supports any number
of cards or players.
