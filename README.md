# Games :video_game:

Browser games I've built for a variety of online events inspired by retro game shows.

I also use them as an opportunity to learn new technologies.

## Play Your Cards Right :black_joker:

Card game built using Vue.js where players compete to correctly guess whether
their next card will be higher or lower.

Supports different settings and multiple players (only in the same browser).
